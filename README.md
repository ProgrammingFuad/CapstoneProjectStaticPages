# Nutrition App Web portal

This project holds the static webpages I am creating in order to fufill my year long capstone course requirments. 
The project entails creating a web portal for a nutrionist having trouble keeping tabs on his patients daily progress.


TODO:
1. Create a page that lists content(video or articles) published by an admin
2. Create a page that lists all patients
3. Create a page that lists a specific patients progress (Calories consumed, cardiovascular readings, etc)
4. Convert the static pages to an angular application
5. Connect to Firebase
